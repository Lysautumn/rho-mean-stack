# rho-mean-stack

Example MEAN stack application for Prime Digital Academy.

This project contains class notes from Prime. In this assignment, I created my first MEAN stack app, where the app takes in names, hometowns, and favorite movies and saves it to a MongoDB collection. That information can then be retrieved from the database and displayed on the DOM.

## How To Use

To use this app, first run npm install in the terminal to download the dependencies for the project. Then, run npm start to start the local server. The app can then be seen at localhost:3000 in the browser.
